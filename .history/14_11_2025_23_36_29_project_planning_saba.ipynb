The `sessions` dataset contains 1535 rows and 5 variables. Each player may have multiple sessions that are linked by their hashed email address. Some individuals who completed the sign-up survey do not have any recorded sessions, and a small group of players have extremely high total play hours, creating a right-skewed distribution. Some demographic variables contain missing values. Session timestamps are stored in both character and large numeric formats. Due to these features, the data will need to be aggregated, cleaned, and joined before analysis can be performed."

    "## 4. Methods and Planning\n",
    "\n",
    "The main purpose of this study is to treat the problem as a classification task. I want to find out whether a player is in the top 25% of total play time (a high data contributor) or if they contribute less to the dataset. To try to predict this, I want to use a K-nearest neighbours (KNN) classifier with factors such as gender, age, experience level, newsletter subscription, and some early session data.\n",
    "\n",
    "KNN seems appropriate because it doesn’t assume any specific pattern or structure in the data. Instead, it looks at whether players are “close” to each other based on their attributes and predicts that they will behave in a similar way. It does have some weaknesses though: irrelevant or very similar predictors can affect it, all numeric variables need to be scaled, and it may struggle if the high-contributor group is much smaller than the rest.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get the dataset ready, I will add up all of the session times for each player to calculate their total play time. Then I will create a variable that marks which players fall into the top 25%. After that, I will split the data into a training set (75%) and a test set (25%). All preprocessing—scaling numeric predictors, encoding categorical ones, and trying out different values of k—will happen only on the training set using cross-validation. Once the best model is chosen, I will test it on the remaining 25% to see how well it performs."
